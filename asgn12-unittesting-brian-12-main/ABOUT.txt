-- Have you used other unit testing frameworks before?  If so, how does CxxTest compare?
In Java, I have used JUnit. Compared Junit, CxxTest is pretty similar to JUnit because
they both give a way to check if an actual result matches your expected result,
both give a way to check if something is true, and both tell you which line failed
a test if an assertion fails. 


-- Did you find gcov useful in this assignment?
Yes, I found gcov useful in this assignment because it allowed me to check if I actually
tested every line of every function of IntArray.cpp.


-- Did you find the unit tests helpful in implementing IntArrayAlgorithms?
Yes, I found the unit tests helpful in implementing IntArrayAlgorithms because if a test
failed, then it's telling me that I implemented my functions wrong. Likewise, if all tests
passes, then it's telling me that I correctly wrote my functions.
