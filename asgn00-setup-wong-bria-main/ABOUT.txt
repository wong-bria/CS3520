-- What was the issue in circle.cpp and how did you fix it?
The issue in circle.cpp was that the formulas for calculating the Diameter, Circumference, and Area of a circle
was wrong. I fixed this issue by changing the diameter from only being radius to 2 * radius. For circumference, 
I changed the formula from radius to 2 * pi * radius. For Area, I changed the formula from radius to 
pi * radius * radius.


-- What was the issue in hello.cpp and how did you fix it?
The issue in hello.cpp was that it wasn't saying/printing the name/the user's input to the console, resulting
in "Hello, !" despite whatever the user inputed. I fixed this by changing the "" to name.


-- What was the issue in numbername.cpp and how did you fix it?
The issue in numbername.cpp was that when you typed 1, 2, or 3, the console would output an empty string
which shows nothing. I fixed this by replacing "" in case 1 with name1, "" in case 2 with name2, and 
"" in case 3 with name3.
