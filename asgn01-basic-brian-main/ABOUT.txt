-- What control structure did you use in fizzbuzz.cpp and why?
I used if statements to validate the user's input and determine if an error
message should be printed.
I then used a for loop as my control structure in fizzbuzz.cpp because I needed to iterate
through a range of number, 1 to 20 specifically, and depending on the number,
I would do print different things. Since I cared about the numbers in the loop,
I used a for loop.


-- Why do you think it is a good idea to check that W and H are in range in rectangle.cpp?
I think it is a good idea to check that W and H are in range in rectangle.cpp because
a rectangle can't have a width or height of 0 or less since it wouldn't make sense. 
We also wouldn't want the width or height to be greater than or equal to 21 because
we wouldn't want to print a rectangle that is too big.


-- How did you check for end of input in sum.cpp and lineno.cpp?
In sum.cpp, I put "cin >> num" as a while loop condition which would check for end of input
and turn false if there is.
In lineno.cpp, I put "getline(cin, input)" as a while loop condition which would also
check for end of input and turn false if there is.
