# Assignment: Basic Programs



## Overview

In this assignment you will get set up and create basic programs.

Starting from the provided repository, which includes starter code, reference
implementations, and test cases, write the following programs
in C++ in each source file.

Requirements:
* **Modifiable files:** You can edit each program's `.cpp` file.



### fizzbuzz

This program prompts the user to separately enter two integers F and B, read from standard input. If either F or B <= 0, or there is an input error, the program prints "Invalid input." and exits. Otherwise, it prints out the numbers from 1 to 20 each on their own line; however, for numbers that are multiples of F it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, numbers that are multiples of B it prints "Buzz" instead of the number, and for numbers that are multiples of both F and B it prints "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.



### rectangle

This program prompts the user to separately enter two integers W and H, read from standard input. If either W or H <= 0 or >= 21, or there is an input error, the program prints "Invalid input." and exits. Otherwise, it prints out a rectangle made of X that is W wide and H high.



### calc

This program prompts the user to to separately enter a word W and a double X, read from standard input. If there is an input error, or W is not "sin" or "cos", the the program prints "Invalid input." and exits.  Otherwise, it prints the result of applying the function named by W to X, with at most three digits of precision.



### sum

This program does not prompt the user, and reads whitespace-separated integers from standard input until end-of-file or any stream error conditions are encountered, and then prints the sum of the integers.



### lineno

This program does not prompt the user, and reads lines of text from standard input until until end-of-file or any stream error conditions are encountered, and prints the lines with the line number prepended.  The line number should start at 1, be followed by a colon, and be left padded with spaces to at least three characters long.
