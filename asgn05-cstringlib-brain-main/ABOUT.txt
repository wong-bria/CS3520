-- How did you handle strings that are not the same length in strcmp?
I handled string that are not the same length in strcmp by checking
if str1 ends before str2 through identifying if it has a null terminator
at index i when I iterate through str1 and str2 by i. If str1 has a null
terminator first, then str1 ended first. If str2 has a null terminator first,
then str2 ended first.


-- How did you start from the end of the string in strrchr?
I started from the end of the string in strrchr by first finding the
length of the string I want to search through. Afterwards, I used
a for loop where I initialized it to start from the length I found until it is
than zero. I would also subtract by one to iterate backwards through the string.
That way I could start from the end of the string in strrchr.


-- How did you look for a substring in strstr?
I look for a substring in strstr by first checking if str2 is empty.
If it is, then I return the entire str1.
Afterwards, I find the length of str1 and str2. If the length of str2 is greater
than the length of str1, then I return the null terminator.
Otherwise, I iterate through str1 by looking from 0 to the length of str1 - the 
length of str2 since those are the only spots where str2 could start inside
of str1. Then, I compare each character in each string and check if they are equal.
If they are equal, then I continue until the entire length of str2. If I'm able
to iterate through the entire str2 length, then a substring has been found
and will return the starting pointer of where the search started. Otherwise,
return a null terminator to indicate that a substring was not found.
