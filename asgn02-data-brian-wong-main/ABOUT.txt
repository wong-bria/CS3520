-- How did you display two fixed digits of precision in median.cpp? What might be an alternative approach?
In median.cpp, I displayed two fixed digits of precision by using
"cout << fixed << setprecision(2)."
An alternative would be doing "cout.precision(2);
    cout << fixed << median << endl;"


-- What data types did you use in frame.cpp and why?
In frame.cpp, I used vector<string>, string, size_t, and const string&.
I used vector<string> because I needed a way to store multiple lines of 
text input, and I don't know how much lines the input may be, which makes a vector
a good choice.
I used string because I needed a way to store each line of input before
adding it into vector<string>.
I used size_t because I needed to compare an input's length to a variable called
max_length to set the find the max_length. Since the input's length is a long 
unsigned int, I couldn't use int for max_length, so I used size_t.
I used const string& because I did not want to modify the text, and I
wanted to refer to each string without coyping it since I didn't need to.


-- How did you ignore additional input on lines in grid.cpp?
In grid.cpp, I ignored additional input on lines with "cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\n');."
