-- How did you check for input errors when reading in board size and moves?
When reading in board size, I checked for input errors in
game_input_board_size by checking if cin failed, or if
the given size is less than 2 or greater than 5 since
we only want the board size to be from sizes 2 to 5, inclusive.
When reading in moves, I check for input errors in 
game_display_board_and_input_next_move by checking if cin failed,
or if row is greater than or equal to the board size, if
col is greater than or equal to the board size, and if 
the spot the user is trying to place is not blank.


-- Was there any impact of making Board::size unsigned? Do you think it would be better if it were signed or not?
An impact of making Board::size unsigned was that when I was
comparing row and col size to the board size, I had to make sure
that the row and col variables were also unsigned. Another impact
was that it made the board size only be postive numberes.
I think it is better that it is unsigned because negative inputs 
as the size would not make sense.


-- Describe your approach to checking if a player has won.
I checked for row, then column, then each diagonal to check if a player has won.
For checking row, I iterate through each row of the board, and for each
row with col 0, if it is not blank, then I check if it contains an X or O. 
I then iterate through that entire row and check if they have a different symbol.
If they are not equal, then no row win. If they are all the same, then there
is a row win. I will then check what symbol was at the start of that row and
say that symbol is the winner.

Checking for column win is the same as checking for row win, but now with columns
instead and I check everything with row0 first to determine the symbol to compare.

For diagonal win (top-left to bottom-right), I determine the symbol
of the top-left. I then iterate through the diagonals to the bottom-right 
with a for-loop and check if they are different symbols. If they are, then no
diagonal win. Otherwise, there is a diagonal win.

Same thing for diagonal win (top-right to bottom-left), but I determine the 
top-right symbol first.
