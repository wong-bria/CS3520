-- Which these tools might you use if your program is crashing on specific user inputs and why?
I would use both the gdb debugger and Valgrind for checking memory errors. I would use
the gdb debugger because I can use the step function to see how different inputs affect
the flow of the program and identify where unexpected behavior or invalid operations occur.
I would also use Valgrind for checking memory errors because I would be able to identify what sort
of errors might be occuring, such as invalid read/write or unitialized value errors.


-- Which these tools might you use to determine how much of your code is tested by unit tests and why?
I would use gcov to determine how much of my code is tested by unit tests because it can show
how many times each line of code was executed. So if a line of code was not ran, then I would know
that that part of my code has not yet been tested by a unit test.


-- What is a change you might make to address one of the issues in valgrind_vector_as_string.cpp?
A change I might make to address the issue of "Invalid write of size 1" in valgrind_vector_as_string.cpp 
is by changing "for (unsigned int ii = 0; ii <= buffer.size(); ++ ii) {" to 
"for (unsigned int ii = 0; ii < buffer.size(); ++ ii) {". By doing this, it would prevent an out-of-bounds access.
