I found that run_vector_at has 950,002,469 instruction count and accounted for 64.94%
of total cost, and run_vector_brackets has 510,001,087 instruction count and accounted for 
34.86% of total cost. This is probably because at() has bounds check, so I would
use at() when I need to do bound checking and I would use brackets if I'm
completely sure that the indices are valid.

relevant lines from the callgrind_annotate output:
