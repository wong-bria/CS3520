VALUE 1: m2 = 505. I ran the debugger, then entered the input "b". Then,
it showed that there was an "Arithmetic exception" on line 28. This
indicated to me that this was when the division by 0 error occurred
since ii = 0 and was the divisor. I then looked at at varialbes -> locals on
the left and saw that m2 = 505.

VALUE 2: m1b = 34. I put a breakpoint on line 8, "cout << "mystery" << endl;" I 
then ran the debugger, and entered "21". I then clicked step into 3 times,
the word "mystery" was printed, I saw i = 10, and I saw that m1b = 34.

VALUE 3: i = 19. I put a breakpoint on line 39, "mystery1b();" I then ran the debugger
and entered 21. I then clicked step into until I saw m1b turn to 28 a second
time. When m1b turned 28 a second time, I saw that z = 28, i = 19, m1b = 28.
