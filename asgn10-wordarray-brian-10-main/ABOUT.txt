-- In the WordArray constructor that takes a charater array as an argument,
 how did you split the string into words?
In the WordArray constructor that takes a character array as an argument, it
splits the string into words with the appendWords method which takes in temp--
a copy of the input words. In appendWords, it uses strtok to split the sstring into words
by the delimiter " ". 



-- How did you append the words from one array onto another?
I appended the words from one array onto another by using appendArray
inside of append. If there are no words from the array I want to append from, then
nothing happens. I then calculate if the number of words in the array I want to
append to plus the number of words in the array I want to append from is greater than
the max words the array I want to append to can hold. If it is, then increase
the max number of words the array can hold to the number of words in the array plus
the number of words in the array I want to append from. 
Afterwards, I call appendArray which has a for loop from 0 to the size of the array 
I want to append from. For each index starting from 0, I get the word called word from 
the array I want to append from, then I allocate a new block of memory called wordCopy to 
store a copy of the current word with a plus one to account for the null terminator.
 Then I use strcpy to copy word into wordCopy. Afterwards, I assign wordCopy to
 the array I want to append to at the position equal to the current index of the
 for loop. I then increase m_numWords since there is a word appended to the array. 
 Then the loop continues.


-- Did you find valgrind useful on this assignment?
Yes, I found valgrind useful on this assignment because I had memory leaks
that caused two tests to fail and valgrind was able to show me 
the relavent lines that were causing the issue, which allowed me
to have a better understanding on where in my code I needed to focus on
to fix the issue and pass the test.

-- Did you use any external resources? If so, cite them below. If not, write no.
I went to online TA office hour for help on fixing my code since
two of append tests were failing.


-- Did you use any LLM-based tool? If so, cite them below and fill out LLM.txt. If not, write no.
no.

It took me about 4.5 hours to complete this assignment.
