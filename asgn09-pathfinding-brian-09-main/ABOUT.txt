-- What did you think of the Red Blob pathfinding tutorial?
I think the Red Blob pathfinding tutorial is a good resource. The code provided
on the website was pseudocode I could use to help with my implementation
of the path finding algorithms, which was a nice resource to have. The animations
on the website also looks cool.


-- Why did we need to define operator< for Point and PriorityPoint?
I think we needed to define operator< for Point and PriorityPoint because
they are needed for a set and map. In a set and map of Point or PriorityPoint,
we need a way to compare values to keep them sorted, which is why operator<
had to be defined for Point and PriorityPoint.


-- Which did you prefer implementing, BFS or A*, and why?
I prefer implementing BFS because I'm more familiar with BFS so it was easier 
for me to implment BFS compared to A*.
