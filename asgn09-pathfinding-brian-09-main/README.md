# Assignment: Pathfinding


## Overview

In this assignment you will implement some functionality of a grid
world, along with breadth-first-search (BFS) and A* algorithms for
finding paths through it, using standard library algorithms.

[You can find an introduction to and overview of the BFS and A*
algorithms
here](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html). The
page provides Python implementation examples, which you can use as a
starting point. You should implement the "early exit" version of
BFS. The page has a link to a C++ implementation, but do not refer to
or copy that implementation.

Implement the A\* frontier priority queue directly using
a vector and the [standard library heap data structure algorithm
functions](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/)
(i.e. std::push_heap, std::pop_heap, etc). Note that a "heap" data
structure is different from the "heap" region in memory. You can find
some more information on using these functions to manage heap data
structures
[here](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/03/13/heaps-priority-queues-stl-part-1/).

Worlds for pathfinding are initialized using an id, which is a seed
used to randomly add elements to the world.

Note that since there may be multiple possible shortest paths from the
start to the goal, the tests will not check the exact path found, but
just the length and connectivity of the path.

The file pathfinding_main.cpp implements a simple text command input system for using
the system.  A command reference is given below.

Starting from the provided repository, which includes starter code,
reference implementations, and test cases, fill in the areas marked
TODO to complete the program in C++.

Remember to to fill out the ABOUT.txt (and LLM.txt if needed).

Requirements:

* **You must implement the pathfinding algorithms using the standard library objects
  provided at the beginning of pathfind_bfs and pathfind_astar
  (i.e. std::vector, std::deque, std::map).**

* **You must implement the BFS frontier queue using a deque.**

* **You must implement the A\* frontier priority queue directly using
a vector and the standard library heap algorithms
(i.e. `std::push_heap`, `std::pop_heap`, etc). Do
not use `std::priority_queue`.**

* **Modifiable files:** You can edit `World.cpp` and `Pathfinding.cpp`.
