-- How did you make the Shape class abstract?
I made the Shape class abstract by declaring the display and translate 
functions are pure virtual functions by using the virtual keyword along with
"= 0" at the end of the function declaration.


-- What was different about the functions you implemented for the [] operator on Vector2D?
The only difference between the functions I implemented for the [] operator on Vector2D
is that in one function header, I put the const keyword at the start and end of the header 
to define a const element access, while in the other function header, I have the same body
and function header except the header doesn't have the const keyword at the start
or end of the header to define a non-const element access.


-- How did you pass arguments into the stream operator functions?
I passed ostream& into the stream operator functions by passing it in by 
reference so I can modify the stream directly and chain operations. I also
made it non-const so I can insert data into it, such as os << v.m_x.
I also passed const Vector2D& v as a constant reference because I don't want 
v to be modified in the function.
